I will be joining [Robinhood](https://robinhood.com/us/en/){:target="_blank"}'s office in Menlo Park, CA as a Backend Software Engineer in August 2022.

I'm an alumnus of the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://cs.washington.edu){:target="_blank"} at the [University of Washington](https://washington.edu){:target="_blank"} where I earned my B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science.

My primary interests lie in:
