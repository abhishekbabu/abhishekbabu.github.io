I'm an alumnus of the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://cs.washington.edu){:target="_blank"} at the [University of Washington](https://washington.edu){:target="_blank"}.

I'm earned my M.S. in Computer Science through the [Combined B.S./M.S. Program](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/bsms){:target="_blank"} at the Allen School in June 2022. I earned my B.S. in Computer Science with a [minor in Mathematics](https://math.washington.edu/math-minor){:target="_blank"} and specialization in the [Data Science option](https://cs.washington.edu/academics/ugrad/current-students/degree/data-science){:target="_blank"} from the Allen School in June 2021.

I will be joining [Robinhood](https://robinhood.com/us/en/){:target="_blank"}'s office in Menlo Park, CA as a Backend Software Engineer in August 2022. My primary interests lie in:
